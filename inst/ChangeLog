Cocorresp Change Log

Version 0.1-3

	* scores.symcoca() incorrectly returned the wrong site
	scores for matrix X. Reported by S. Juggins.
	
	* corAxis.symcoca() incorrectly called scores with 
	argument ''extract'' instead of ''display''. Reported 
	by S. Juggins.
	
	* Added flush.console() calls to crossval() and
	permutest.coca() to make sure the progress is
	printed to the console in Mac OSx and Windows. Suggested
	by S. Juggins.
	
	* Added argument n.axes to permutest.coca to control the
	number of axes tested. Defaults to x$n.axes to maintain
	backwards compatibility. Suggested by S. Juggins.
	
	* Minor typos in documentation fixed, and removed 
	\dQuote{} from within \code{} chunks as it was not being
	processed as I expected.

Version 0.1-2

	* First Public Release
